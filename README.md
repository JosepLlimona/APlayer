How to use:
- This app reads a folder and all of its subfolders in search of video files.
- Then all the videos are displayed in order.
- Choose a video to play.
- The app will keep track of which folder has been read, so there's no need to indicate it manually.
- The app will remember which video and the time when it was closed.

Observations:
- The main purpose is to watch downloaded anime, so the app will detect that at minute 22:30, the episode has already finished and it will save the next if you close it.

Future objectives:
A list of folders that have already been red.

Disclaimer:
This app does not encourage any form of piracy. Use it in your free will.
